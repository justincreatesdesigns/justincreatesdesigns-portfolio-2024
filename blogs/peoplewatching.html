          <h1>People Watching</h1>
          <p>
            Humans are among the most complex creatures in the animal kingdom.
            If animals could observe us, they might think we’re crazy. We walk
            on two feet, eat a wide variety of foods, experiment on and consume
            plants, and ride in metal machines, among many other things.
            <br /><br />
            This often puts us on the opposite end of the spectrum from how most
            animals live. Take cats, for example. Their daily routine is usually
            simple: eat, sleep, run around, and occasionally seek attention.
            They might nap for half the day, only to wake up, meow for food or
            affection, and then go back to resting. <br /><br />
            Their lives are relatively consistent and straightforward. In
            contrast, human lives can be unpredictable and varied—even from the
            moment we wake up. Our routines can change so much that we have apps
            to help manage our time. However, like cats, we also crave
            attention. We engage in activities such as playing video games,
            hanging out with friends, posting on social media, or even
            skydiving. (Okay, that last one is a bit extreme, but you get the
            idea.)<br /><br />
            The ways we seek attention are far more diverse and complex than the
            way animals do. Humans are amazing creatures capable of displaying a
            wide range of emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. Our uniqueness
            comes from our individual experiences, upbringings, cultures, and
            genetics. So, embrace your differences, and remember that everyone
            around you is unique too.
