                Working closely with my team: Kong & Lutfiah my classmates from
                Ngee Ann, we were tasked to create a promotional video for a
                product of our choosing. Utilising our new knowledge with AE
                (After Effects) & creative design process to come up with the
                video.

              <p>
                Our 3 goals were:<br />
                <br />
                - Finding a style for the target audience? <br />- How are we
                gonna show the features? <br />- Give them a reason to why they
                should use Spotify.
              </p>

                Getting some inspiration from other Spotify Ad's from youtube.
                To guage how we want to position our style and vibe.

                Script was broken down into 3 parts.
                <br /><br />
                Part 1 of the script is to highlight that Spotify is a platform
                that is accessible anywhere.
                <br /><br />
                Part 2 is to highlight the infinite number of genres there are
                on the platform.
                <br /><br />
                Finally, part 3 is the combination of these last 2 parts the
                reason why people should use Spotify. Key messaging was that you
                can find any song, anywhere in the world at anytime.

                <br />
                <br />
                Some of the things we also took into account was the breakdown
                of how the workload should be split and how do we piece it all
                together. As the script was already broken down into 3 parts, we
                decided that we would all just take 1 part and animate as
                according to the storyboard.

                Storyboarding! Discussing with my team and finding the right
                motion to convey the message from the script.
