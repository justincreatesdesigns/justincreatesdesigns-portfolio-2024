          <h2>Overview Objective</h2>
          <p>
            Scoop Wholefoods (https://sg.scoopwholefoods.com) sends out a
            discount coupon on a member's birthday month and would like you to
            create a new EDM for this purpose.
          </p>
          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            Some issues I faced when creating the design for this EDM was
            getting a cohesive layout, choosing the right typeface as well as a
            to create compelling graphic with the assets given to me.
            <br /><br />
            How can I capture the attention of the user to open the email, get
            them hooked onto reading the email and eventually claiming their
            reward and stick to Scoops identity of being a very eco-friendly by
            using recyclable materials.
          </p>
          <h2>Solution</h2>

          <p>Used a moodboard to get the style and layout that I want.</p>
          <div class="article-img">
            <img src="/img/moodboard-edm.png" alt="moodboard" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Started mindmapping to get ideas of what to use for graphics and
            vibe for the EDM.
          </p>
          <div class="article-img">
            <img src="/img/mindmap-edm.png" alt="moodboard" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Before I went to designing the EDM I drafted out some layouts using
            shapes to visualize that final design.
          </p>
          <div class="article-img">
            <img src="/img/layout-draft-edm.png " alt="moodboard" />
          </div>

          <h2>Design</h2>
          <p>
            Designing the EDM was a rocky journey, working with my friends and
            colleagues for feedback. The EDM's design has been reiterated to
            what it is now. (Wish I still had the old versions to show but yea
            they were something...)
          </p>
