          <p>
            Digital media has been the norm in everyone's lives at this point,
            due to the huge amount of online platforms accessible to everyone.
            Conveying messages, ideas, stories, or products through proper
            communication has become increasingly noticeable. This has given
            rise to the concept of UX (user experience) by crafting a visual
            journey for the viewer using images, typography, colour, texture and
            many more. But where do we begin?
          </p>

          <div class="content">
            <h3>#1 Alignment</h3>
            <p>What do you see when you look at this photo?</p>
            <div class="article-img">
              <img src="/img/alignment.png" alt="alignment beer bottles blue" />
            </div>
            <p>
              Incase you didn't see it, it was the pack of beers that was
              misaligned! See how such a small detail can be so noticeable?
              Proper alignment helps ensure that you have a clean structure
              which will build a visual appeal to the viewer.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="content">
            <h3>#2 Contrast</h3>
            <div class="article-img">
              <img src="/img/contrast.png" alt="contrast colour pop door" />
            </div>
            <p>
              Contrast is a great way to catch attention by using unique
              elements that stand out. The best use of this is 2003’s Apple’s
              advertisement called the “iPod Shuffle.”
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="content">
            <h3>#3 Repetition</h3>
            <div class="article-img">
              <img src="/img/repetition.jpg" alt="repeat green chairs" />
            </div>
            <p>
              Repeating visual elements promotes consistency and unity which can
              also help in creating consistency in your design.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="content">
            <h3>#4 Proximity</h3>
            <div class="article-img">
              <img
                src="/img/proximity.png"
                alt="items grouped phone watch glasses"
              />
            </div>
            <p>
              Proximity is the final principle to tie this all together.
              Grouping things together in your design allows viewers to
              collerate things in groups or individuals. Such as for example
              your navigation bars on phones or websites to content where like
              the photo above is accompanying text right now that allows you to
              participate in this activity!
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            That’s about it! Now that you're equipped with these 4 principles,
            get out there and bring your ideas to life.
