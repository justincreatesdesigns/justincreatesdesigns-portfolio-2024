          <p>
            As humans we are the most complex creatures to exist in the animal
            kingdom, animals will look at us and think we are crazy. We walk on
            two feet, eat all kinds of meat, experiment on plants, eat them too
            and ride on metal machines, plus many other things humans can do
            today. Putting us on the opposite spectrum of how animals live.
          </p>

          <p>
            In comparison, for example, cats. Generally, the things they do are
            eat, poop, run around and maybe if they get tired they sleep for
            half the day until someone disturbs their peace then meows at people
            for more food or attention then sleep again. Their lives tend to be
            more simple and consistent. Unlike us, our daily lives can vary from
            the day you start waking up or even before you sleep. Our patterns
            are unpredictable and endless to the point that there are even
            applications to help you manage your time and try to do the
            predicting for you.
          </p>

          <p>
            But just like cats we also like attention. We do that by partaking
            in activities such as playing video games, hanging out with friends,
            posting on social media, and jumping out of planes. OK, the last one
            is a bit extreme but you get the point.
          </p>
          <p>
            People are amazing creatures capable of doing many things. We
            display a wide range of emotions, thoughts and behaviours and our
            uniqueness comes from individual experiences, upbringings, cultures
            and genetics.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, embrace your differences. Everyone around you is unique too.
