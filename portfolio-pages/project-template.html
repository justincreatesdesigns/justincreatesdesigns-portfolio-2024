                  Provide a brief description of the project, outlining what was
                  requested or your own conceptual goals. For assignments,
                  mention the task given by the instructor or client, and for
                  concept projects, explain the problem or opportunity you
                  identified and aimed to solve.
                  <br /><br />
                  Example for Assignment: This project involved designing a logo
                  and visual identity for a startup in the sustainable fashion
                  industry. The goal was to create a modern and versatile brand
                  identity that could be applied across both physical and
                  digital platforms.
                  <br /><br />
                  Example for Concept: This self-initiated project explores the
                  idea of creating a branding system for a fictional zero-waste
                  cafe. The concept focuses on creating a visually engaging
                  identity that reflects sustainability, minimalism, and a
                  community-driven atmosphere.

                <h3>The Challenge/Inspiration</h3>
                <p>
                  Explain the key challenges or constraints of the project. For
                  assignments, this could include the guidelines or restrictions
                  imposed (e.g., color palette, target audience, medium, etc.).
                  For concept work, explain any hurdles you wanted to explore or
                  the problem you were trying to solve.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Example for Assignment: The brief required the logo to be
                  versatile for both small and large-scale applications.
                  Additionally, it needed to reflect the brand’s commitment to
                  sustainability while still appearing modern and approachable.
                  I also had to work within a specific color palette of earth
                  tones.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Example for Concept: The challenge was to create a brand
                  identity that felt fresh and engaging while remaining grounded
                  in the principles of sustainability. The concept needed to be
                  flexible enough for use across packaging, promotional
                  materials, and an online presence.

                <h3>My Approach</h3>
                <p>
                  Describe your design process—how you tackled the assignment or
                  concept, including any research, ideation, and development.
                  Highlight the methods or tools you used (sketching, digital
                  prototyping, mood boards, etc.), and how you approached
                  problem-solving and iteration.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Example for Assignment: I started by researching sustainable
                  fashion brands to understand the visual language of the
                  industry. I created mood boards with eco-friendly themes and
                  selected a color palette based on natural hues. After
                  sketching multiple logo ideas, I narrowed them down and
                  presented the top three to my instructor for feedback. I then
                  refined the chosen design in Illustrator and tested it in
                  mockups.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Example for Concept: To develop the brand, I began by
                  researching current trends in sustainable design and
                  zero-waste lifestyles. I sketched various logo concepts
                  inspired by organic shapes and minimal typography. After
                  refining my ideas, I chose a simple typographic logo paired
                  with earthy, neutral tones. I then explored packaging designs
                  and social media concepts to see how the identity could scale
                  across different applications.
                </p>

              <div class="portfolio-details">
                <h3>Design Solution</h3>
                <p>
                  Explain the final outcome of your work. For assignments,
                  describe how the design meets the brief's requirements. For
                  concept projects, describe how your solution reflects the
                  ideas and challenges you set out to address. Discuss key
                  design elements like typography, color choices, and visual
                  style.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Example for Assignment: The final logo features a clean,
                  geometric design with subtle references to nature, using a
                  minimal color palette of muted greens and browns. The logotype
                  uses a rounded sans-serif font to evoke warmth and
                  approachability, while the symbol represents sustainability
                  through an abstract leaf motif. I created business cards and
                  social media templates to ensure the identity works across
                  multiple platforms.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Example for Concept: The branding concept features a
                  minimalist logo that uses negative space to represent the idea
                  of “emptying out” or reducing waste. The logo is paired with
                  earthy, muted tones and simple, modern typography. I also
                  designed a series of eco-friendly packaging solutions and
                  promotional materials, all reflecting the brand’s commitment
                  to simplicity, sustainability, and a zero-waste lifestyle.

                <h3>Impact & Results (Optional)</h3>
                <p>
                  If the project was part of a real-world brief (assignment or
                  client work), mention the outcome, such as feedback, usage, or
                  any measurable results. For concept work, focus on how the
                  project helped you grow or what you learned, and if you
                  received any recognition.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Example for Assignment: The project received positive feedback
                  from my instructor, especially for the versatility of the logo
                  and its alignment with the brand’s core values. I was also
                  able to apply the identity system across digital and physical
                  media, ensuring consistency in various contexts.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Example for Concept: The concept was well-received in a design
                  critique, with particular praise for its simplicity and
                  adaptability. The project helped me refine my skills in
                  sustainable design practices and further explored how visual
                  identity can support eco-conscious brands.
