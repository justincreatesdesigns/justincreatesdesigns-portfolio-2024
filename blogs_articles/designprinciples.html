          <p>
            Digital media has been the norm in everyone's lives at this point,
            due to the huge amount of online platforms accessible to everyone.
            Conveying messages, ideas, stories, or products through graphic
            design has become increasingly noticeable. This has given rise to
            the concept of UX (user experience) by crafting a visual journey for
            the viewer using images, typography, colour, texture and many more.
            But where do we begin?
          </p>

          <h3>#1 Alignment</h3>

          <p>What do you see when you look at this photo?</p>
          <img src="" alt="" />
          <p>
            Yes! The pack of beers that are misaligned. See how such a small
            detail can be so noticeable? Proper alignment helps ensure that you
            have a clean structure which will build a visual appeal to the
            viewer.
          </p>
          <h3>#2 Contrast</h3>
          <img src="" alt="" />
          <p>
            Contrast is a great way to catch attention by using unique elements
            that stand out. The best use of this is 2003’s Apple’s advertisement
            called the “iPod Shuffle.”
          </p>
          <h3>#3 Repetition</h3>
          <img src="" alt="" />
          <p>
            Take a look at McDonald’s for example. Take note of their use of
            colour, shapes and images. Do you realise there is a consistent
            theme? Repeating visual elements promotes consistency and unity
            which can also help developing an identity.
          </p>
          <h3>#4 Proximity</h3>
          <img src="" alt="" />
          <p>
            Again, just like how we started, what do you see? Yes! The french
            fries package. Proximity helps with categorising your visual
            elements in your graphic. Bringing elements close, far or around
            using this principle can display your visuals as a unit or in
            different sections.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s about it! Now that you're equipped with these 4 principles,
            get out there and bring your ideas to life.
          </p>
